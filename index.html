                <p class="quote">I could not understand where should i start from !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
                <p class="quote">Let me express myself here what i felt all these 9 years by recalling all the memories</p>
                <p class="quote">Before getting into btech life, I didn't even know how the btech life would be...But Many of us might felt that Btech would be as same as the HappyDays movie showcased the Life :P.</p>
                <p class="quote">Myself after intermediate was done, literally no idea which college should i prefer to and which branch should i choose.. Anyhow, Had a counselling and selected few colleges and corresponding branches as well.</p>
                <p class="quote">Got AITS,Rajampet with EEE branch. So at that point time, I felt it was the correct one for me. Without any hesitation ..Joined the college and participated in orientation program as well. Not sure if you also were there at that time in the gallery.</p>
                <p class="quote">Yes, First year got started, Was not aware how we should be and what things should we follow.. the environment over there was quiet different at that time and moved on with it.</p>
                <p class="quote">Basically, I was like a nerd since schooling , the same vibes continued in the btech first year as well. Somewhere i started using Facebook due to the influence of my friends. Frankly speaking i was addicted to that as well. May be that was one of the reason to change my nerdiness in the middle of firstyear itself.</p>
                <p class="quote">Seriously, I am literally a shy person who can't even dare to talk to girls. In my schooling as well, Never spoke out much with girls..Vaishu had known this as we were in the same school since 4th standard onwards.</p>
                <p class="quote">As far as i remembered, at the end of the btech only , I clearly saw your face as there was no chance of communication happened btw us becoz we were splitted into two groups in all the labs. In the first year, Mainly we spent most of the time in the labs only instead of being in the classrooms.</p>
                <p class="quote">So we used to be in different groups at that time. I wanna tell you the impression i got on you at that time was , You must have known right, I used to have crush on NithyMenon. </p>
                <p class="quote">Please don't think that it is an exagaretting or silly thing. I truly felt some similarties like </p>
                <p class="quote">She is short as You are </p>
                <p class="quote">She smiles so good as You are.</p>
                <p class="quote">She has a chubby and innocence face as you have. </p>
                <p class="quote">May be these mentioned things made me to switch my crush on her to on you Becoz I can't get her but I may get you if i make an attempt to impress you. Thats where i started off sending friend request in FB.</p>

              <div class="col-12 text-center quoteSec">
                <p class="quote">As you also used to respond to my messages well and we became good friends in the 2nd year. </p>

                <p class="quote">Then i asked your whatsapp number as well...Initially you didn't share with me. Later you have shared. Thats how our friendship kicked off.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I thought to present something on your birthday ra in the 3rd year, See I could have given any valuable things like Gadgets, Dresses etc.. But I believe that you can rememember me whenever you put it on. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">So I decided to express my opinion on you to make you feel that You are Unique, I believe , By doing that, You can remember me whenever your bday comes up.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">So I presented that thing , Hope It made you feel impressed and I expressed wat i felt about you in it. You must have known that I celebrated your birthday as my bday at that time. I felt myself that I must have done much more ra , Sorry for not presenting you in the form of things ra.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Thats how , Our 3rd year was done with much texting in whatsapp and facebook together.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Entered into final year and everything was going up very well in all the ways. Don't know why god wanted me to suffer at that time, We met with an accident, and myself only got injured much in that accident. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">Actually we met with an accident at 10am, we had been taken to the RIMS at 11am, Around 3pm all our mates were there in the hospital ra.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I realised , By the end, only friends can be there with us in any situation. I was so happy at that time even though there was a lot of pain i had for my leg fractured by seeing all of them. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">I was told that you also asked how they were now, It made me feel that you were also there for me ra.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">You know, Doctor who treated me at that time told me that there might be a chance of taking off the leg if it gets infected. By god's grace , Nothing had happened.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Surgery went well, and i had been asked to stay in the hospital only for 1 week ra. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">At that time, You and mamatha came, I still remember that I had happy tears seeing you there. That i will never forget in my life. The feeling which i had when my love came for me is unable to express ra.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Thank You sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Much for that ra..Even for mamatha too.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Later, Hod didn't accept to provide the attendance for me ra. So i used to come to college by auto for around 2 months. Everyday it costed 700rs ra. Yet came just to finish off the btech.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I was unable to write records, but you assisted me in that as well. Truly this one also made me feel much loved on you ra. But i couldn't express at all. You could hv helped if anyone was there in that position, thats your character.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Thats how, I got prepared somewhat and completed btech without any backlogs.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I thought to express my feelings on the farewell day itself ra, but i was not dare enough to do that. so i was so calm.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I used to have some anger on you for not giving me your slambook as you have given that to lokesh. It made me feel so unhappy. You knew right..Some days i didn't text and i didn't write your slambook as well. Thats the reason.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Btech exams were done, Farewell was done.. Then What was the next. That is the only question kept hunting me. </p>

                <p class="quote">I was not cured that much at that time, Financially we were weak. Couldn't understand what should i do. Apart from these, I needed to express my feelings to you. Because I truly felt you r my right choice to my Life Race.</p>

                <p class="quote">I thought to disclose this matter atleast, otherwise i couldn't get a chance. So I expressed in an indirect way to know how you would react. I knew you are that kind of girl who won't agree these kind of things. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">But I used to have a hope that we were close to eachother, Considering that closeness, I thought you would accept. But you didn't by saying "simply i was not interested. I am not treating you in that way". I tried somewhat to convice you to a particular extent, yet you didn't agree.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Then Myself realised that "Love is neither generated nor created, It should happen in them, Nothing will give , if you force someone to love". On that day, I decided not disturb you again in my lifetime.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I blocked you in all the ways we had, Just becoz to deviate myself from you. May be blocking you might be easy , But Blocking you in mind and heart was toooo difficult to handle. I took a lot of pain to get out from the feelings i had on you. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">Left the learning course of HTML,CSS which i already started off for around 2 months, I couldn't even concentrate on those. I knew how hard it was. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">Cried sometimes for losing you, Nothing in my hands to get back to you.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">How could i be deserved for you. I have nothing to show you that i am the one who can give you an happy life. Had a thought that Y shouldn't come to you after being successfull instead of being unsuccessfull in life.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Then, Family problems, Financial Problems, Relatives taunting, All these thing pushed me hardly and made me to focus much on career first. The day i decided, I was been so dedicated from then.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I didn't even know how to write hello world program. But these situations made me learn them with much focus and dedicated on it.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Later as i said, I left for hyderabad and joined in a startup with the help of my relative, where i learned basics clearly. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">And after that i felt i need to learn much, it was not possible in startup...So i switched to another company. Where the life went better only because of the people over there and made me feel relived whenever i was in mood off.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Along with that, Sometimes, I couldn't even control my pain seeing you wandering with our mates in banglore. But I decided to get you back as a successfull person.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">I thought to reach you in 2018, But i was not that much confident about my life whether i was settled well or not. </p>
                
                <p class="quote">Thats why i waited for 5 years eventhough it was tough for me, I just did it for family and you.</p>
                
                <p class="quote">Now I can call out loudly that I Can take care of you and provide you a very happy life which you wish for. </p>
