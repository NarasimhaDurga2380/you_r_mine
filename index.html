                <p class="quote"><b>I used to have a wish in btech.</b></p>
                <p class="quote">If you do accept my love, On feb 14th, I wanted to say that you r my valentine by offering you a rose.It didn't happen at all in the btech times. </p>
                <p class="quote">Even though it happened after 9 years of btech, You r ready to leave me and making my wish die out. </p>
                <p><b>I wanna express you the pain i had since last 2 months and let you know that YOU R MY VALENTINE EVER. </b></p>
                <h4 class="quote">Two statements from you really made me cry which i controlled alot</h4>
                <ul class="quote">
                  <li>You told that you lost the impression on me when i asked you to understand me. It really killed me inside. 
                    I could understand you that you had a pain becoz of me as i didn't have spare time for you. 
                    Ofcourse it makes us hurt. It was my fault only, i agreed that. but it doesn't me that there is no love. Serioulsly at that time, i thought to not to disturb you. 
                    But Love on you didn't let me leave you becz I mentally sticked to <b>YOU R MY LIFE PARTNER</b>3</li>
                  <li>You told that i was talking to you when i get feelings.You degraded my character over there by saying that. 
                    As soon as you said that, i wanted to go away from you.But I could understand you that you would never say that intentionally. 
                    I am telling you this to make you understand that, Sometimes situations made us behave like that. 
                    It doesn't mean that we don't love eachother. It means that we are having a fear of losing eachother. 
                    Sometimes words can break the relationship. I never expect my love to be end.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
                <p class="quote">
                  Every day morning i used to think of you as i m addicted to your GOOD MORNING message. 
It is not coming from you and it is making me feel that i lost the big thing in my life. I got the dreams for 3 times in the last one month.
Everyday i used to check that you are online or offline by opening your profile for 10 to 15 times in a day. Basically I addicted to you as i feel "YOU R MY LIFE PARTNER"
                </p> 
                <p>
                  I could understand you have your problems at your home. But seriously Y you didn't reject my proposal like you rejected me in btech. 
I am unable to imagine my life without you now. I am unable to force you to love and marry me. 
                </p>
                <p class="quote">I felt <b>YOU R MY LIFE PARTNER</b>. It really kills me when <b>YOU BECOME SOME OTHER PARTNER.</b> </p>
                <p class="quote">From the last before month, I observed that you are not interested in talking to me and not interested in marrying me as well.
                  I tried my level best to convince you as same as when i proposed you after the btech completion. 
                  But the way you were responding to my messages was not the same way you were when we were in love. I truly felt you have been forcing by me.
                  </p>
                  <p class="quote">On the 1st day of year itself you made me disappoined. I was awake to express my beautiful moments happened with you in the last even though i am getting on 31st night. 
                    I made something and sent you. I waited for about 1hr for your reply. I expected atleast the reply would be the same feeling from you. But you didn't even feel it. 
                    Simply replied like that you are sending wish to the stranger as forward message and simply ignored my token of happiness for you. 
                    So I decided not to disturb you again in my life as you might felt that i am not the correct person for you.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="quote">THEN AND NOW, I FEEL ,I DONT EXPECT FORCEFUL LOVE, I WANT TO HAVE UNDERSTANDABLE LOVE. I ALWAYS WAIT FOR THAT FROM YOU ONLY.</h4>
                    <p class="quote">I am not the good one as per you. But my love for you is not the bad one. </p>
                    <p class="quote">I was waiting to say this on FEB 14 only. MM, which myt be employed by others to call you as short. 
                      According to me, MM is not just for it, I felt like you r <b style="color:red">MY MOTHER(MM).</b></p>
                    <h4 class="quote" style="color:darkorange"><b>I WANTED TO LIVE IN YOUR LOVE. BUT YOU WANTED TO LEAVE FROM MY LOVE.</b></h4>
                    <h4 class="quote" style="color:coral"><b>MY LOVE FOR YOU WILL NEVER DIE EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU GET TIED THE KNOT BY SOMEOTHER ONE. STAY HAPPY AND HEALTHY.</b></h4>
